* Scaling software with Akka

** Managing system overload

** Scale up and scale out

Written using scala but had to provide scala and java APIs.

Wrappers for groovy, scala etc.

Wanted one way of both scaling out and scaling up.

Scaling up: improving hardware scaling on same box. Scaling out: more
hardware.

Up/out shoudl just be a deployment decision. So you should be able to
design software free of worrying about this

** How?

Using actors.

Akka is more than just actors. Actors one tool in the tool box.
